\todo{Do we want to say a word about groups = symmetry and manifolds = calculus?}
\todo{Also, do we want to motivate these objects at all?}

\section{Lie Groups = Symmetry + Calculus}
  
\begin{defn}
  A \important{Lie Group} is a group in the category of manifolds.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  A \important{Lie Group} is a group that is also a manifold%
  \footnote{and the operations should be smooth with respect to this structure.}.
\end{defn}

Given a Lie Group $G$, its tangent space at the identity is called a 
\important{Lie Algebra}, often written $\mathfrak{g}$.

\missingfigure{$S^1$ with the tangent line at the origin}

In this image, our group $G = \{ e^{i \theta} \mid \theta \in \R \}$,
and its lie algebra is $\mathfrak{g} = \{ i \theta \mid \theta \in \R \}$.

Lie algebras let us reduce problems about Lie groups to linear algebra.

\section{The Plan}
\todo{So this makes sense as part of a day 1 of lecture, but should we 
put this in a preface or something instead of right here?}

In this book, we'll cover

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{General Theorems} about Lie Groups and Lie Algebras \todo{Are we still planning to "skip many proofs?"}
  \item \textbf{Examples} -- These are the key to really \emph{understanding} Lie groups.
  \item \textbf{Applications} to 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Geometry -- Felix Klein's idea \todo{cite the erlangen program, a historical account, or another book?}
        that a geometrical figure (a point, line, etc.) is "really" an action of a Lie group on a manifold.
      \item Quantum Physics -- The idea \todo{can we trace this to anyone like we can Klein?} a type of particle
        is "really" an action (or \emph{representation} in this context) of a Lie group on a Hilbert Space.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{A Review of Manifold Theory}

\begin{defn}
  An ($n$-dimensional) \important{Topological Manifold} is a topological space $M$ so that
  each point $x \in M$ has an open neighborhood $U_x$ homeomorphic to $\R^n$.

  We may also call $M$ an $n$-manifold.
\end{defn}

\todo{Add a thing in the preface that says %
``the reader familiar with Tu's intro to manifolds will recognize the influence on this section'' %
or something like that. I really did lift this almost verbatim.}

A fixed homeomorphism $U_x \to \R^n$ is called a \important{Chart}, and
we call two charts $\varphi : U \to \R^n$, $\psi : V \to \R^n$ 
\important{Compatible} if the two maps 
$\varphi \circ \psi^{-1} : \psi(U \cap V) \to \varphi(U \cap V)$ and 
$\psi \circ \varphi^{-1} : \varphi(U \cap V) \to \psi(U \cap V)$ are 
smooth (by which we mean $C^\infty$).

These two maps are called the \important{Transition Functions} between
the charts. 

\missingfigure{A figure indicating what it means for charts to be compatible}

\begin{defn}
  An \important{Atlas} on a topological manifold $M$ is a collection of 
  compatible charts whose domains cover $M$.

  An atlas is called \important{Maximal} if any chart $\varphi : X \to \R^n$
  not in the atlas is incompatible with some chart in the atlas.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  An ($n$-dimensional) \important{Smooth Manifold} is a topological 
  $n$-manifold $M$ equipped with a maximal atlas. 

  Unless otherwise stated, by ``manifold'' we will always mean a smooth
  manifold. 
\end{defn}

\begin{ExerciseList}

\Exercise[label={ex:automatic-compatibility-of-charts}]
Let $\mathfrak{A}$ be an atlas on a topological manifold $M$. 
If $(U, \varphi)$ and $(V, \psi)$ are both compatible with every
chart in $\mathfrak{A}$, then they are compatible with each other too.

\Exercise[label={ex:atlases-extend-to-maximal-atlases}]
Every atlas $\mathfrak{A} = \{ (U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha) \}$ on a 
topological manifold $M$ is contained in a (unique!) maximal atlas.
(Hint: consider all charts compatible with every chart in $\mathfrak{A}$,
then use the previous exercise to argue that this is still an atlas)

This exercise shows that we don't need to define a maximal atlas to put a 
smooth structure on a topological manifold. In practice, we almost always 
work with a much more manageable atlas with only finitely many charts.
  
\end{ExerciseList}

\bigskip

Where there are objects, there are arrows, and we should consider the 
maps between manifolds as well. 

\begin{defn}
  Let $M$ and $N$ be manifolds. A function $f : M \to N$ is called 
  \important{(Smooth) Map} if for every $x \in M$ there are charts
  $(U_x, \varphi)$ and $(V_{f(x)}, \psi)$ so that 
  $\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}$ is smooth.
\end{defn}

\begin{ExerciseList}
  
\Exercise[label={ex:any-chart-works-for-smooth-map}]
Show that if the above definition works for \emph{some} charts
$(U_x, \varphi)$ and $(V_{f(x)}, \psi)$, it actually works for 
every pair of charts whose domains are neighborhoods of $x$ and $f(x)$.
(Hint: transition functions are smooth).

\end{ExerciseList}

\missingfigure{Indicate the definition of a smooth map with potatoes and arrows}

\begin{defn}
  The smooth manifolds and smooth maps together form the category $\mathsf{Diff}$.

  An isomorphism in this category%
  \footnote{that is, a pair of maps $f : M \to N$ and $g : N \to M$ so that 
  $f \circ g = \id_N$ and $g \circ f = \id_M$} is called a \important{Diffeomorphism}.

  We consider two diffeomorphic manifolds to be ``the same''.
\end{defn}

Let us define Lie Groups exactly one more time.

\begin{defn}
  A \important{Lie Group} is a manifold $G$ equipped with smooth maps 

  \begin{itemize}
      \item $\cdot : G \times G \to G$ 
      \item ${}^{-1} : G \to G$ 
  \end{itemize}

  and a point $1 \in G$ so that $(G,1,\cdot, {}^{-1})$ is a group.
\end{defn}

The attentive reader will notice the sleight of hand. What does it mean
to have a smooth map from $G \times G \to G$? We know that $G$ is a manifold
by assumption, but why should $G \times G$ be one!? 

\begin{defn}
  Given an $m$-manifold $M$ and an $n$-manifold $N$ 
  (with atlases $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$, respectively), the 
  product topological space $M \times N$ becomes an $(m+n)$-manifold by
  considering the atlas

  \[
    \big \{ 
      (U \times V, \varphi \times \psi) 
    \mid 
      (U, \varphi) \in \mathfrak{A}, (V, \psi) \in \mathfrak{B} 
    \big \}
  \]

  (which we can extend to a maximal atlas by exercise 
  \ref{ex:atlases-extend-to-maximal-atlases})

\end{defn}

\todo{Do we want to prove that this really is a manifold? Or leave it as an exercise? Or not mention it at all?}

\begin{ExerciseList}
  \Exercise[label={ex:categorical-product-of-manifolds}]
  Prove that this construction really is a product in the categorical sense. 
  That is, show 

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The topological projection maps $\pi_1 : M \times N \to M$ and 
      $\pi_2 : M \times N \to N$ are smooth
    \item For any manifold $X$ and for any maps $f : X \to M$ and $g : X \to N$,
      there is a unique map $f \times g : X \to M \times N$ making the following
      diagram commute:
  \end{enumerate}

  \missingfigure{You know the one}
\end{ExerciseList}

\section{Examples of Lie Groups}

\todo{You said (out loud) a lot of words about each of these examples. 
I can try to imitate your voice, or you can write some words here. 
Let me know what you prefer.}
  
\subsection{$(\R^n, +)$}

More generally, any real or complex vector space $V$ becomes a Lie group 
under vector addition.

\subsection{$\mathsf{GL_n(\R)}$}

\begin{defn}
  The ($n \times n$, real) \important{General Linear Group} 

  \[ \mathsf{GL}_n(\R) = \big \{ \text{invertible $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $\R$} \big \} \]

  is a Lie group with matrix multiplication as its operation.
\end{defn}

This is clearly a group, but why is it a manifold, and why are multiplying
and inverting matrices smooth operations?

The key observation is that $\mathsf{GL}_n(\R)$ is an open subset of 
$\mathcal{M}_n(\R)$ (the space of all matrices), which is an $n^2$-dimensional
vector space (and thus a manifold).

This is because $\text{det} : \mathcal{M}_n(\R) \to \R$ is a polynomial in
the entires of the matrix, thus it's continuous (smooth, even!) and 
$\mathsf{GL}_n(\R) = \text{det}^{-1} \{ x \in \R \mid x \neq 0 \}$ is an 
open subset of $\mathcal{M}_n(\R)$.

So to know that $\mathsf{GL}_n(\R)$ is a manifold, it's enough to show

\begin{thm}
  An open subset of an $n$-manifold is an $n$-manifold
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  I'm feeling lazy right now.

  \missingfigure{The visual from the notes showing what's happening}
\end{proof}

So $\mathsf{GL}_n(\R)$ is a manifold. Why is it a Lie group?

Notice multiplication

\[
  (A,B) \mapsto (AB)_{i,j} = \sum_k A_{ik} B_{kj}
\]

and inversion

\[
  A \mapsto A^{-1}_{ij} = \frac{(-1)^{i+j} \text{minor}_{ji}}{\text{det}(A)}
\]

are both polynomial maps. In particular, they're smooth.

\todo{I should probably double check that the inversion formula is exactly right.
It's definitly \emph{something} like this\ldots}

\todo{Also, we should probably put in a few more words about what minors are, etc?
Either that, or call this an exercise, and say "consider the minors", etc as a hint?}

\bigskip

It will come as no surprise that we can use $\C$ instead of $\R$ above, and
everything goes through unchanged.

\begin{defn}
  The ($n \times n$, complex) \important{General Linear Group} is

  \[
    \mathsf{GL_n}(\C) = \big \{ \text{invertible $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $\C$} \big \}.
  \]

  This is a Lie group with matrix multiplication and inversion.
\end{defn}

Again, this is a manifold because it is an open subset of the $2n^2$-dimensional
(real) vector space $\mathcal{M}_n(\C)$ of $n \times n$ complex matrices and
the group operations are polynomials (thus smooth).

\subsection{Closed Subgroups}

We can also get new Lie groups from old.

\begin{thm}
  A closed subgroup%
  \footnote{That is, if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ which is topologically closed} 
  of a Lie group $G$ is itself a Lie group.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  $H$ is a submanifold of $G$, and the group operations restrict to smooth
  maps on $H$. For a formal proof (which would take us into more manifold 
  theory than we would like), see F. Warner's 
  \emph{Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups}, p. 110
  (I stole this reference from Tu's book).
  \todo{This is the first of many theorems which we didn't \emph{really} prove
  in lecture. I personally think we should 
  keep the philosophy of ``don't prove everything'', and just provide a 
  reference where the proof normally goes (as I did here). If we're doing this, 
  we should mention it in the preface}
\end{proof}
